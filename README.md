To download this application and run it on your machine you have a few options.

1. You can download it as a zip, toss it in a directiory and click on the 'index.html' file.

2. You can fork it to your github, clone the drive and run it from an internal HTML server.
http-server is what you will use to make your web sites work in the browser. If you don't already have it install js node. <br><br> https://nodejs.org/en/ <br><br> Once that is complete, open your terminal and type in the following command. <br><br>
`npm i -g http-server` <br><br>
That code in the terminal will install the server.  Now that the installation is complete, use the terminal to navigate to the directory conatining your cloned files.  Once you have taken care of this enter the follwing code into your terminal <br><br>
`hs -o` <br><br>
This should open up a web browser with the site inside of it.
